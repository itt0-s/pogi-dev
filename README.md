# `pogi.dev` Homepage

## Background

This repo contains the code for the homepage displayed at [pogi.dev](https://pogi.dev). As this is my first time hosting on my own domain, I am also using this repository (and the deployed pages) as a testing ground.

Since I am already testing, I am also planning to use NextJS for this project, which I also don't have experience prior to this project. I already have React basics knowledge, which is helpful in learning NextJS. This may be an overkill for a landing page (even React might be overkill), but over time I am planning to expand the features of this project if I have extra time.

## Deployment

The homepage is deployed using Vercel-Github integration.

## Installation Commands

List of commands I used in setting up NextJS project as recommended from their docs

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
npx create-next-app@latest --use-pnpm
```

## Redirects

Other domains I own also redirect to `pogi.dev`, namely:
[itt0.dev](https://itt0.dev)
[itt0.com](https://itt0.com)

## NextJS README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
